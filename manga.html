     <br>
     <h3>In many anime and manga series, the idea of a "match made in heaven" is often portrayed as a romantic relationship between two characters that is meant to be, despite any obstacles or challenges that may arise. This concept can be seen in a variety of different anime and manga, such as Fruits Basket, where the main character Tohru Honda is meant to be with the cursed Sohma family member, Yuki, or in Clannad, where the main character Tomoya Okazaki eventually ends up with Nagisa Furukawa.

        This idea of a "match made in heaven" can also extend beyond just romantic relationships. In the anime and manga series Fullmetal Alchemist, the main characters Edward and Alphonse Elric are meant to be together as brothers, despite the challenges they face in trying to restore their bodies. Similarly, in the anime and manga series One Piece, the main character Monkey D. Luffy is meant to be with his crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, despite the many dangers they encounter on their journey.
        
        It can be argued that the concept of a "match made in heaven by chance" is used as a way to add a sense of destiny or fate to the story. It creates a sense that the characters are meant to be together and that their relationship is meant to happen, regardless of the obstacles they may face. This can add an element of hope and optimism to the story, as the audience can believe that even if the characters face difficult challenges, they will ultimately end up together.
        
        Furthermore, the idea of a match made in heaven by chance also can be a representation of the idea that love and relationships are not always easy and straightforward but are worth pursuing and working through the challenges for. It can also be a representation of the idea that people are not always perfect and that it is possible to find happiness and fulfillment despite their flaws.
        In conclusion, the concept of a "match made in heaven by chance" is a common theme in anime and manga and serves to add a sense of destiny and hope to the story. It can also be interpreted as a representation of the idea that love and relationships are worth pursuing and working through challenges for, as well as the idea that people can find happiness despite their flaws.</h3>
